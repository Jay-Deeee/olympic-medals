This is a personal small project to kickstart my journey to learn Python and coding Machine Learning scripts. This specific project aims to predict how many olympic medals a country will win in a year based on past data. It will be trained using previous years' data of how many medals each country won and how many athletes they entered, then using that same template for testing where after predictions are made (using athletes entered and medals won in the previous year) will compare those predictions with the latest year where error is the absolute value of medals won - medals predicted.
